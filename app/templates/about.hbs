              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <br>
              <p>A love of logic and numbers from an early age, and a love for languages, led me from Electrical Engineering camp in high school, to Yale University, to becoming the unofficial head of IT for SeaChange Capital Partners, a non-profit investment bank in the city. After two years of building their Salesforce system and managing their website, in addition to fulfilling other responsibilities as an Associate (amongst them, building excel models and writing/presenting investment recommendations), I have dedicated myself full-time to computer programming. </p><br>

              <h2>What I Do</h2>
              <br>
              <p>I am a full stack developer at NimbleStack, a six-person company that specializes in automating software and building chatbots powered by artificial intelligence. I build the front-end and back-end of chatbots using HTML/CSS, Javascript, React.js, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, and several public APIs.</p>
             

              <h2>Who I am</h2>
              <br>
              <p>I am a well-travelled, multi-cultural woman with past experience in technology, the world of investing, international journalism, teaching, and politics. I am a citizen of three countries (United States, Colombia, and Spain), have travelled to, lived, or worked in over twenty different countries, and speak three different languages (English, Spanish, and French).<br><br>

              I thrive on teams of passionate developers/engineers and am open to learning languages/frameworks not currently in my repertoire.
